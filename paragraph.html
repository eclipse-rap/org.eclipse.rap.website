  The Remote Application Platform (RAP) is a framework for modular business applications
  that run on a server and can be accessed from different types of clients including web browsers,
  rich clients, and mobile devices. It provides a powerful, multi-platform widget toolkit that
  enables developers to write applications entirely in Java and re-use the same code on different
  platforms. RAP integrates well with proven technologies such as OSGi and JEE.
