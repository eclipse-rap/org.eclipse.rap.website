    <h2>Update to Eclipse Jetty 12</h2>

    <p>
        With the integration of Eclipse Jetty 12 in the Eclipse Platform, it was possible to upgrade
        the dependencies and the tooling in Eclipse RAP from Jetty 10 to 12.
    </p>
    <p>
        Internally, Eclipse RAP is still using JakartaEE 8/javax.servlet.*, and based on Servlet 4.0.
