    <h2>Update to Eclipse Jetty 12</h2>

    <p>
        With the integration of Eclipse Jetty 12 in the Eclipse Platform, it was possible to upgrade
        the dependencies and the tooling in Eclipse RAP from Jetty 10 to 12.
    </p>
    <p>
        Internally, Eclipse RAP is still using JakartaEE 8/javax.servlet.*, and based on Servlet 4.0.
    </p>

    <h2><code>jakarta.annotation</code> - RAP Tools 3.27.1 Service Release</h2>

    <p>
        Eclipse Platform changed their E4 annotations from <code>javax.annotation</code> to 
        <code>jakarta.annotation</code>. This change is reflected in the service release provided for
        RAP Tools 3.27.1 which provides updated project templates.
    </p>

    <h2>Security Issue</h2>

    <p>
        In Eclipse RAP versions from 3.0.0 up to and including 3.25.0, Remote Code Execution is
        possible on Windows when using the <code>FileUpload</code> component - see
        <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4760">CVE-2023-4760</a>for details.
        The fix is part of all official releases since RAP 3.26.
