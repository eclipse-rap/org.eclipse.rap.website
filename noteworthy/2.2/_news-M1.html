  <h2>Theming</h2>

  <h3>Theme Extensions</h3>

  <p>
    The theming was extended in serveral places:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>ProgressBar</code> has a new themeable property <code>width</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>box-shadow</code> property has been added to buttons.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Application Context</h2>

  <h3>Application Context Listener</h3>

  <p>
    <code>ApplicationContextListener</code>s can be attached to an application context to receive a
    notification before the application context is destroyed.
  </p>

  <h2>ClientScripting</h2>

  <p>
    The ClientScripting has been graduated and now it's included in the RAP core. ClientScripting
    allows developers to handle some of the events directly on the client, without creating any
    http-requests. This is ideal to customize or enhance the behavior of specific widgets, making it
    much less often necessary to develop RAP custom-widgets.
  </p>
  <p>
    More information about ClientScripting can be found
    <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Incubator/ClientScripting">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ClientScripting incubator projects are no longer compatible with RAP 2.2M1+ and must be used
    <strong>only</strong> with older RAP versions.
  </p>

  <h2>Widget Set</h2>

  <h3>Synchronize user data with the client</h3>

  <p>
    It's now possible to transfer the data attached to the SWT widget to the client. To do so, the
    key for that data has to be registered with
    <code>WidgetUtil.registerDataKeys( String... )</code>.
    Example:
  </p>

<pre class="lang-java">
WidgetUtil.registerDataKeys( "foo" );
widget.setData( "foo", "bar" );
</pre>

</div>
