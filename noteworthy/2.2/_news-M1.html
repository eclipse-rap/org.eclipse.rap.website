  <h2>Theming</h2>

  <h3>Theme Extensions</h3>

  <p>
    The theming was extended in several places:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>ProgressBar</code> has a new themeable property <code>width</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>box-shadow</code> property has been added to buttons.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Application Context</h2>

  <h3>Application Context Listener</h3>

  <p>
    <code>ApplicationContextListener</code>s can be attached to an application context to receive a
    notification before the application context is destroyed.
  </p>

  <h2>RWT Scripting</h2>

  <h3>Migrated ClientScripting to RAP Core</h3>

  <p>
    The ClientScripting project has been graduated from the incubator and is now included in the RAP core
    as <q>RWT Scripting</q>. Using the new <code>ClientListener</code> class, it is possible to handle some
    events directly on the client without the usual latency caused by HTTP requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    The number of supported widgets and what properties can be changed on the client is
    expected to be expanded until the RAP 2.2 release. For now the following widgets
    support ClientListener:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Text</code></li>
    <li><code>Button</code></li>
    <li><code>Canvas</code></li>
    <li><code>Composite</code></li>
    <li><code>Label</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Supported events are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>SWT.KeyDown</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.KeyUp</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.MouseDown</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.MouseUp</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.MouseMove</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.MouseEnter</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.MouseExit</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.MouseDoubleClick</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.FocusIn</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.FocusOut</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.Paint</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.Modify</code></li>
    <li><code>SWT.Verify</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Consult the new Developers Guide "Scripting" article more information on ClientListener,
    and the WebClient API reference to find out what widget methods are available in RWT Scripting.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> The ClientScripting incubator project is no longer compatible with RAP 2.2M1+
    and must be used <strong>only</strong> with older RAP versions. If you port code based on
    the incubator ClientScripting to RAP 2.2 Scripting, please note that the namespace
    for <code>ClientListener</code> has been changed to <code>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.scripting</code>, and
    that the number of supported widgets has been reduced.
  </p>

  <h3>Synchronize user data with the client</h3>

  <p>
    It's now possible to transfer the data attached to the SWT widget to the client. To do so, the
    key for that data has to be registered with
    <code>WidgetUtil.registerDataKeys( String... )</code>.
    Example:
  </p>

<pre class="lang-java">
WidgetUtil.registerDataKeys( "foo" );
widget.setData( "foo", "bar" );
</pre>

  <p>
    The transferred data can then be used in RWT Scripting:
  </p>

  <pre class="lang-javascript">
    function handleEvent( event ) {
      var data = event.widget.getData( "foo" );
    }
  </pre>

  <h2>Client Services</h2>

  <h3>Improved JavaScriptLoader</h3>

  <p>
    The JavaScriptLoader implementation has been improved in the following aspects:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Files can be loaded form any URL:</b>
      Previously the JavaScriptLoader could only load scripts served by the RAP application,
      e.g. by registering them with the resource manager. Now any URL that is reachable by the
      client can be used.
    </li>
    <li><b>Browser no longer blocked during loading:</b>
      The JavaScriptLoader now uses asynchronous HTTP request to load the JavaScript file,
      which means the browser no longer becomes unresponsive while waiting for the request to finish.
    </li>
    <li><b>Scripts appear in Browser Developer Tools:</b>
      Previously the loaded scripts did not appear in the "sources" or "scripts" tabs of
      the browsers debugger (e.g. Firebug).
    </li>
  </ul>
