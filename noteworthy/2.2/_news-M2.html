  <h2>Widget Set</h2>

  <h3>FileUpload supports Multiple File Selection</h3>

    <p>
      The <code>FileUpload</code> widget now allows selecting and uploading multiple files at once
      in HTML5 enabled browser. To enable this feature, create the widget with the <code>SWT.MULTI</code>
      style flag like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="lang-java">
  FileUpload fileUpload = new FileUpload( parent, SWT.MULTI );
  </pre>
    <p>
      To obtain the filenames from the widget the method <code>getFileNames</code> has been introduced.
      The method <code>getFileName</code> (singular) also still exists and will return the first
      selected file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browser (such as Internet Explorer 8) that do not support this feature will simply ignore
      the <code>MULTI</code> flag.
    </p>

  <h3>Revised ToolTip Behavior</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>ToolTips generated by the <code>setToolTipText</code> method will now appear faster.
    The exact time until the ToolTip appears depends on the widget (they appear faster on Button-like widgets).</li>
    <li>ToolTips will no longer disappear automatically after a timeout. The exact coditions
    for them to disappear depend on the widget, but they will always disappear when the mouse
    is moved away from the widget or a key is pressed.</li>
    <li>Appear and disapper  animations may be skipped in some situations.</li>
    <li>ToolTips for buttons, items and fields will be placed above/below (in same cases besides) the widget, not over it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Theming</h2>

  <h3>Revised and Extended ToolTip Theming</h3>

   <p>
     ToolTips have a new black look in the default theme.
   </p>
   <img src="./images/tooltips.png"/>
   <p>
     A new theming element has been introduced: <code>Widget-ToolTip-Pointer</code>.
     The element has a single property "background-image" and four states: "up", "down", "left", "right".
     If set, the image may be attached on the ToolTip to point towards the widget it describes.
     The states are set depending on which direction the ToolTip is supposed to point.
     The image should match the background and/or border color of the ToolTip theming.
     A full set of four images would be defined like this:
   </p>
   <pre class="lang-css">
Widget-ToolTip-Pointer {
  background-image: none;
}

Widget-ToolTip-Pointer:up {
  background-image : url( tooltip-up.png );
}

Widget-ToolTip-Pointer:down {
  background-image : url( tooltip-down.png );
}

Widget-ToolTip-Pointer:left {
  background-image : url( tooltip-left.png );
}

Widget-ToolTip-Pointer:right {
  background-image : url( tooltip-right.png );
}
</pre>


</div>
