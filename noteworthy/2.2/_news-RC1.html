  <h3>Row Templates improved</h3>
  <p>
    Several open issues with the new Row Templates have been resolved.
    All scale modes for image cells are now also supported in IE7/8.
    One new scale mode has been added (<em>ScaleMode.STRETCH</em>).
    Text cells can now also contain markup.
    The theming for Table and Tree has a new state <em>rowtemplate</em> to allow to make
    adjustments specific to row templates.
    The default theme uses this state to hide vertical grid lines when row templates are used.

  <h3>Deployment issues resolved</h3>
  <p>
    There has long been <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=407371">an issue</a>
    with RAP applications deployed as <em>.war</em> files that could not be properly stopped or
    undeployed and even prevented the servlet container from shutting down.
    These problems have been fixed.
    Stopping and un-deploying RAP applications works like a charm now.

  <h3>Adjusted to IE11</h3>
  <p>
    The new Internet Explorer version 11 has just been released,
    and for the first time this browser does not identify itself as “MSIE” anymore,
    but as “Trident” (the name of the rendering engine).
    This totally confused our web client wihch did not recognize this browser correctly and even
    <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=421529">failed</a> in the
    Eclipse embedded browser.
    We've adjusted it to support this new generation of IE browsers properly.
