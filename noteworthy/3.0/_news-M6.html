  <h2>FileDialog migrated to RAP Core</h2>

  <p>
    The file dialog and file upload components have been moved from the
    <a href="http://eclipse.org/rap/incubator/">RAP Incubator</a> to the RAP repository.
    <em>FileDialog</em> supports not only single and multi file upload with a clean user interface,
    but since recently also file drag and drop.

  <h2>Badge support for Push Button and ToolItem</h2>

  <p>
    In the second milestone of RAP 3.0 we added badge support for <em>TabItem</em>. Now, this has
    been extended to <em>Button</em> and <em>ToolItem</em>, both with style <em>SWT.PUSH</em>.
  </p>

  <img class="framed" alt="Badges on Button" src="./images/badges_push.png"/>

  <p>To set a badge, use:</p>

  <pre lang="java">button.setData( RWT.BADGE, "12" );</pre>

  <h2>Minimum Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari version raised</h2>

  <p>
    In RAP 3.0, the web client will support the following web browsers/rendering engines:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Internet Explorer 9 and later</li>
    <li>Google Chrome 29 and later</li>
    <li>Firefox 23 and later</li>
    <li>Safari 6 and later</li>
    <li>Opera 15 and later</li>
    <li>iOs 6 and later (Safari)</li>
    <li>Android 4 and later (stock browser
      (<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Mobile_Browser">limited)</a> and Chrome)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In some older browsers RAP may continue to work, but without additional modern HTML5/CSS3
    features.
