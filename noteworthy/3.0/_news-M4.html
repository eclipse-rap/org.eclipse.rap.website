  <h1>Widget Set</h1>

  <h2>Enhanced Scale theming</h2>
  <p>
    The Scale widget theming has been enhanced with the following CSS properties and states:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>background-image</code> property for Scale and Scale-Thumb</li>
    <li><code>HORIZONTAL</code>/<code>VERTICAL</code> selectors for Scale and Scale-Thumb</li>
    <li><code>hover</code> state for Scale-Thumb</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>SWT.IMAGE_DISABLE and SWT.IMAGE_GRAY support for Images</h2>
  <p>
    It's now possible to create disabled and grayed images at runtime, using the SWT constants <code>IMAGE_DISABLE</code> and <code>IMAGE_GRAY</code>.
  </p>

<pre lang="java">
Image disabled = new Image( display, srcImage, SWT.IMAGE_DISABLE );
Image grayed = new Image( display, srcImage, SWT.IMAGE_GRAY );
</pre>

  <h2>Test API</h2>

  <p>
    When you test your UI components, you have to simulate the environment that RAP UI code
    normally runs in (including the UI thread, a UISession, ApplicationContext etc.)
    To do so, we provide the bundle <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.testfixture</em>.
    However, we always claimed that the classes therein were not part the public RAP API.
  </p>

  <p>
    From now on, we provide public API for unit tests in the form of a JUnit Rule.
    Instead of calling <code>Fixture.setUp()</code> and <code>Fixture.tearDown()</code>,
    you now only need to include the following line in your test cases.
    This will simulate a new test context for every test method.
    There's also no need to fake the <em>PROCESS_ACTION</em> phase anymore.
  </p>

<pre lang="java">
&#064;Rule
public TestContext context = new TestContext();
</pre>

  <p>
    The class <code>Fixture</code> and all its companions have been moved to the internal package
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.testfixture.internal</em>.
  </p>
