  <h2>Revised default ToolBar theming</h2>

  <img class="framed" alt="ToolBars with various style flag combinations" src="./images/toolbars.png"/>

  <p>
    Exploiting some of the new theming features, the <em>ToolBar</em> has a new default look combining all 
    items to a single visual element. Single items are still distinguishable when hovered with the mouse. The previous 
    look is also still available, simply by setting the <em>SWT.FLAT</em> style flag. 
    This flag is used by default in workbench applications, so these will still look the same. The business theme
    is also not affected by this change.
