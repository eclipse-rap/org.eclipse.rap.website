  <h1>Theming</h1>

  <h2>New property <q>text-overflow</q></h2>

  <img class="framed" alt="Table items with ellipsis" src="./images/ellipsis.png"/>

  <p>
    <em>Table</em> and <em>Tree</em> items (and columns) now support the <q>text-overflow</q> property.
    It can can be set to <q>ellipsis</q>, which causes text that would be cut off to end with
    <q>...</q> instead. The default RAP theme already uses this property, if you use any other
    theme the default value is <q>clip</q>.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes in ProgressBar</h2>

  <p>
    The ProgressBar has been partially rewritten to use CSS3 properties instead of vector graphics.
    As a result the indicator is now more precisely layouted when the bar is nearly empty or nearly
    full, but as a side-effect the <q>ProgressBar-Indicator</q> theming no longer supports the
    <q>border</q> propery. It was not used by any of the themes included in RAP, so it won't change
    how the bar looks by default.
  </p>

  <h1>Browser Support</h1>

  <h2>Minimum Internet Explorer Version raised</h2>

  <p>
    RAP 3.0 will require Internet Explorer 9 or above. Dropping support for Internet Explorer 8
    allowed us to remove thousends of lines of JavaScript code and will also enable more HTML5/CSS3
    feature in the future. For Windows Vista, IE9 can be manually installed.
    For Windows 7, IE10 is installed with Service Pack 1 and IE11 can be installed manually.
    Windows 8 has IE10 as it's default browser, which is upgraded to IE11 with Windows 8.1.
    If you still target Windows XP, you have to use either Firefox or Google Chrome.
