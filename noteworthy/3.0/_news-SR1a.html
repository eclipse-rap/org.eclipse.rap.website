  <p>
    Between the Mars and Mars.1 release, two issues have been introduced in the base platform
    that can lead to exceptions in RAP (<?=bug(479113)?> and <?=bug(479115)?>).
    Unfortunately, the affected Equinox / Jetty bundles are included in the 3.0.1 (“SR1”)
    service release, so upgrading from RAP 3.0.0 to the complete RAP 3.0.1 target can potentially
    break productive applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make the transition to RAP 3.0.1 safe, we provide an update of the SR1 service release,
    named </em>SR1a</em>.
    The RAP bundles in SR1a are identical to the ones in SR1, only the platform bundles have been
    replaced with the ones from the Mars release.
