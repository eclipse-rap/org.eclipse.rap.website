    <h2>Support for MenuItem Tooltip Text</h2>
    <p>
        New API has been added to support adding tooltip text to <code>MenuItem</code>. If tooltip with
        HTML markup is used, <code>RWT.TOOLTIP_MARKUP_ENABLED</code> must be set as data on the item as
        usual.
        <ul>
            <li><code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.MenuItem.setToolTipText(String)</code></li>
            <li><code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.MenuItem.getToolTipText()</code></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Mouse Wheel Scroll Direction</h2>
    <p>
        With the new <code>count</code> property it is now possible to determine the mouse wheel scroll
        direction by its sign. It is set for <code>MouseDown</code>, <code>MouseUp</code>,
        <code>MouseDoubleClick</code>, and <code>MouseWheel</code> client scripting events.
    </p>

    <h2>Support for <code>MImperativeExpression</code> in RAP e4</h2>
    <p>
        With the synchronisation of the code in <code>MenuManagerRenderer.updateVisibility</code> and
        in <code>ContributionsAnalyzer.isVisible</code> with the upstream code from the Eclipse Platform
        <code>MImperativeExpression</code> are now supported in RAP e4.
    </p>

    <h2>Add Possibility to Disable Shutdown Request</h2>
    <p>
        In certain circumstances it is required to prevent the execution of sendShutdown/sendBeacon, e.g.
        when HTTP 302/303 redirects are intercepted and handled manually.<br/><br/>
        This can be configured within the <code>ApplicationConfiguration</code> by setting an additional
        string property:<br/>
        <code><pre>
  Map<String, String> properties = new HashMap<String, String>();
  properties.put( WebClient.DISABLE_SHUTDOWN_REQUEST, "true" );
  application.addEntryPoint( "/", Demo.class, properties );
        </pre></code>
    </p>

    <h2>Enable Easier Load Testing</h2>
    <p>
        One problem with RAP-based applications and load testing is caused by the text size determination.
        In oder to compute an exact layout, the RAP server asks the web client with probe strings to
        measure their local size in pixels. These requests are triggered by the server, which can be quite
        confusing for any load testing tool which cannot provide that size information by themselves.
        <br/><br/>
        Because the exact size and the perfect layout is not what you are interested in when running load
        tests, we added a new system property <code>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.enableLoadTests</code>. By setting
        this to <code>true</code> the RAP server does not send any texts nor probes for measurement to the
        client, and fills <code>TextSizeStorage</code> and <code>ProbeResultStore</code> with estimates
        instead.

    <h2>Upgrade Apache <code>commons-fileupload</code> to version 1.4.0, <code>commons-io</code> to version 2.11.0</h2>
    <p>
        There were some security reports for earlier version of Apache <code>commons-fileupload</code>.
        Although RAP did not use any of the methods in question, and was therefore not directly affected
        by any of the reported vulnerabilities, it was time to upgrade these external libraries to their
        latest stable version.
        <br/><br/>
        Please note that the new versions are taken from Maven Central and therefore follow a slightly
        different naming scheme with a different bundle symbolic name:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>org.apache.commons.fileupload</code> renamed to
                <code>org.apache.commons.commons-fileupload</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>org.apache.commons.io</code> renamed to
                <code>org.apache.commons.commons-io</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Upgrade to Eclipse Tycho 2.7.5</h2>
    <p>
        In order to mirror the PGP signatures of external dependencies during the build into the RAP
        p2 repositories, an upgrade of Eclipse Tycho to version 2.7.5 was required in RAP Runtime and
        Tools. With this change, the RAP p2 repositories are kept in compliance with the Eclipse
        Simultaneous Release guidelines.
    </p>
