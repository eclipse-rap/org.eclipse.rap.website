    <h2>Support for <code>MImperativeExpression</code> in RAP e4</h2>

    <p>
        With the synchronisation of the code in <code>MenuManagerRenderer.updateVisibility</code> and
        in <code>ContributionsAnalyzer.isVisible</code> with the upstream code from the Eclipse Platform
        <code>MImperativeExpression</code> are now supported in RAP e4.
    </p>

    <h2>Upgrade Apache <code>commons-fileupload</code> to version 1.4.0, <code>commons-io</code> to version 2.11.0</h2>

    <p>
        There were some security reports for earlier version of Apache <code>commons-fileupload</code>.
        Although RAP did not use any of the methods in question, and was therefore not directly affected
        by any of the reported vulnerabilities, it was time to upgrade these external libraries to their
        latest stable version.
        <br/><br/>
        Please note that the new versions are taken from Maven Central and therefore follow a slightly
        different naming scheme with a different bundle symbolic name:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>org.apache.commons.fileupload</code> renamed to
                <code>org.apache.commons.commons-fileupload</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>org.apache.commons.io</code> renamed to
                <code>org.apache.commons.commons-io</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>
