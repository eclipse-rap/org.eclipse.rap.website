    <h2>Enable Easier Load Testing</h2>

    <p>
      One problem with RAP-based applications and load testing is caused by the text size determination.
      In oder to compute an exact layout, the RAP server asks the web client with probe strings to
      measure their local size in pixels. These requests are triggered by the server, which can be quite
      confusing for any load testing tool which cannot provide that size information by themselves.
      <br/><br/>
      Because the exact size and the perfect layout is not what you are interested in when running load
      tests, we added a new system property <code>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.enableLoadTests</code>. By setting
      this to <code>true</code> the RAP server does not send any texts nor probes for measurement to the
      client, and fills <code>TextSizeStorage</code> and <code>ProbeResultStore</code> with estimates
      instead.
