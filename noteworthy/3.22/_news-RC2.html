    <h2>Upgrade to Eclipse Tycho 2.7.5</h2>

    <p>
        In order to mirror the PGP signatures of external dependencies during the build into the RAP
        p2 repositories, an upgrade of Eclipse Tycho to version 2.7.5 was required in RAP Runtime and
        Tools. With this change, the RAP p2 repositories are kept in compliance with the Eclipse
        Simultaneous Release guidelines.
