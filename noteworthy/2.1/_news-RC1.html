  <h3>Handling of duplicate requests</h3>

  <p>
    The RAP server now accepts re-sent requests.
    In case of a connection problem, a client can decide to retry and send the same request again.
    If the server had already received and processed the request, it will send the same response again.
    For details, see <?=bug(383397)?>.

  <h3>Improved Error Messages</h3>

  <p>
    The error message box that is displayed in case of network problems, session timeout etc.
    got a slightly new look.
    All error messages can now be internationalized.
    For details, see <?=bug(365436)?>.
