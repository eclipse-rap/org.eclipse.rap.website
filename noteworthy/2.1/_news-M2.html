  <h3>Accelerator text for MenuItem</h3>

  <p>
    On the MenuItems, all text after a tab character will now be aligned to the right of the item,
    which is typically used to display an accelerator shortcut. Example:
  </p>
  <pre class="lang-java">
MenuItem item = new MenuItem( parent, SWT.PUSH );
item.setText( "Push One\tCtrl+Shift+1" );
item.setAccelerator( SWT.CTRL | SWT.SHIFT | '1' );</pre>

  <p>
    <img class="framed" title="Accelerator text on MenuItems" src="images/accelerator-text.png" />
  </p>

  <h3>Improved Internet Explorer 10 Support</h3>

  <p>
    RAP now uses CSS3 to render rounded borders and gradients in Internet Explorer 10.
    Previously SVG or VML were used (and still are, on older browser) to achieve these effects.
    With this update there are considerably less DOM elements created than before.
