  <h2>Widget Set</h2>

  <h3>Accelerator Text for MenuItem</h3>

  <p>
    On MenuItems, all text after a tab character will now be aligned to the right of the item.
    This feature, called <em>accelerator text</em> is typically used to display an accelerator
    shortcut. Example:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
MenuItem item = new MenuItem( parent, SWT.PUSH );
item.setText( "Push One<strong>\tCtrl+Shift+1</strong>" );
item.setAccelerator( SWT.CTRL | SWT.SHIFT | '1' );
</pre>
  <p>
    <img class="framed" title="Accelerator text on MenuItems" src="images/accelerator-text.png" />
  </p>

  <h3>Support for Display Resize Listeners</h3>

  <p>
    It's now possible to listen to changes of the display size.
    The display size changes whenever the browser is resized or when a mobile device is rotated.
    To do so, attach an untyped <code>SWT.Resize</code> listener to the <code>Display</code>
    as shown in the example below.
    Please note that this feature is not yet supported in SWT (<?=bug(402514)?>).
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
display.addListener( SWT.Resize, new Listener() {
  public void handleEvent( Event event ) {
    System.out.println( "Display size: " + event.width + "x" + event.height );
  }
} );
</pre>

  <h3>Drawing Paths with GC</h3>

  <p>
    The methods <code>GC.drawPath( Path )</code> and <code>GC.fillPath( Path )</code> have been
    implemented.
    Now it's possible to draw complex shapes using the <code>Path</code> API.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="framed" title="Complex shapes" src="images/gc-path.png" />
  </p>

  <h2>Theming</h2>

  <h3>Background position and repeat</h3>

  <p>
    Support for the CSS properties <code>background-position</code> and <code>background-repeat</code>
    has been added to the following widgets: <code>Button</code>, <code>FileUpload</code>,
    <code>Composite</code>, <code>Label</code>, <code>CLabel</code>, <code>Text</code> and <code>Link</code>.
    See <?=bug(361799)?> for more details.
  </p>
<pre class="lang-css">
Composite {
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right bottom;
  ...
}
</pre>

  <h3>Improved Internet Explorer 10 Support</h3>

  <p>
    RAP now uses CSS3 to render rounded borders and gradients in Internet Explorer 10.
    Previously SVG or VML were used (and still are, on older browser) to achieve these effects.
    With this update there are considerably less DOM elements created than before.
  </p>

  <h2>Applications</h2>

  <h3>Built-in Support for Multiple Browser Tabs</h3>

  <p>
    Until now, you had to turn off session cookies in the servlet container in order
    to support access to a RAP application from multiple browser tabs.
    This is not needed anymore.
    The framework can now handle multiple connections from within the same HTTP session.
    For every connection, a new UISession will be created.
  </p>

  <h3>Access ApplicationContext from a UISession</h3>

  <p>
    A UISession now provides a reference to the ApplicationContext it belongs to.
    This allows to access application-scoped instances such as the resource manager
    from a non-UI thread without having to wrap the code in a UISession runnable.
    For example, the following code:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
uiSession.exec( new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    RWT.getApplicationContext().getAttribute( "foo" );
  }
} );
</pre>
  <p>
    can now be replaced with this one-liner:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
uiSession.getApplicationContext().getAttribute( "foo" );
</pre>

  <h2>Custom Widgets</h2>

  <h3>New JSON API, RemoteObject API Change</h3>

  <p>
    In RAP 2.0, we introduced the <em>RemoteObject</em> API that allows custom components
    to synchronize with their client part over the JSON protocol.
    This API was still marked as provisional and is now complemented with a new JSON API
    for marshalling and unmarshalling arbitrary data structures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently, the untyped Objects and Maps in the method signatures of <em>RemoteObject</em> and
    <em>OperationHandler</em> have been replaced with the new JSON types.
    Custom component developers should have a look at the classes <em>JsonValue</em>,
    <em>JsonArray</em>, and <em>JsonObject</em> and adjust their custom components.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, to pass a structured value to the client as a JSON array, you have to create
    a JsonArray instead of Object[]:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
// set property size to 200x300 using a JSON array [200, 300]
remote.set( "size", new JsonArray().add( 200 ).add( 300 ) );
</pre>
  <p>
    For example, to pass a structured value to the client as a JSON array, you have to create
    a JsonArray instead of Object[]:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
remoteObject.setHandler( new AbstractOperationHandler() {

  @Override
  public void handleNotify( String event, JsonObject properties ) {
    int index = properties.get( "index" ).asInt();
    // process event ...
  }
} );
</pre>

</div>
