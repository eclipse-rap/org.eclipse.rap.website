    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        This will make it easier for the community to reuse existing code or
        to utilize new features.
        Here is a list of API methods added in M1:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li><code>FontData()</code> constructor</li>
          <li><code>FontData#setName(),
                    FontData#setHeight(),
                    FontData#setStyle(),
                    FontData#setLocale()
          </code></li>

      q07 Fragment removed
    </title>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        The org.eclipse.rap.rwt.q07 fragment has been removed.
        The contents of this fragment have been moved to the org.eclipse.rap.rwt bundle and the q07
        fragment is not needed anymore.
        <p>
        The q07 fragment had originally been introduced to be able to support different versions of
        the qx client library. Meanwhile, we decided to maintain and evolve our own copy of this
        client library
        (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=320993">bug 320993</a>),
        so the fragment is not needed anymore.
        However, with the new protocol
        (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=311355">bug 311355</a>),
        it will become possible to plug-in alternative clients for RAP.
