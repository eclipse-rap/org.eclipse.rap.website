      New API added
    </title>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        This will make it easier for the community to reuse existing code or
        to utilize new features.
        Here is a list of API methods added in M1:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li><code>FontData()</code> constructor</li>
          <li><code>FontData#setName(),
                    FontData#setHeight(),
                    FontData#setStyle(),
                    FontData#setLocale()
          </code></li>
          <li><code>TreeItem#getImage()</code></li>
        </ul>

      q07 Fragment removed
    </title>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        The org.eclipse.rap.rwt.q07 fragment has been removed.
        The contents of this fragment have been moved to the org.eclipse.rap.rwt bundle and the q07
        fragment is not needed anymore.
        <p>
        The q07 fragment had originally been introduced to be able to support different versions of
        the qx client library. Meanwhile, we decided to maintain and evolve our own copy of this
        client library
        (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=320993">bug 320993</a>),
        so the fragment is not needed anymore.
        However, with the new protocol
        (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=311355">bug 311355</a>),
        it will become possible to plug-in alternative clients for RAP.

      Support for failover cluster
    </title>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[
      Support for transparent session failover was added to RWT. This enables RWT applications to
      run in a high-availability cluster.
      RWT had to be extended in two places to achieve this. An alternate life cycle was implemented
      that does not use a <em>UI Thread</em> and hence isn't compatible with SWT any more. 
      This life cycle also eases integration with JEE as it eases to access to security or 
      transaction contexts.
      <p>
	      The second area of work was to enable sessions to be replicated between cluster nodes. 
	      Therefore all classes in RWT whose instances will have session scope were made serializable.
	      Note that application code must also be prepared in that all objects that live in session 
	      scope must be serializable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Serializable RWT sessions can also be used to swap inactive sessions onto disk and thereby 
        releasing the memory consumed by them. This allows for infinite session timeout settings 
        that result in more user friendly web applications.
      </p>
