  <h2>Target Platform Changes</h2>

  <h2>Replace Equinox DS with Apache Felix SCR (DS)</h2>

  <p>
    The Equinox project added the Apache Felix SCR bundle as a replacement for their old
    Equinox DS implementation. The RAP Equinox Target Feature has been updated to reflect this
    change. <em>org.eclipse.equinox.ds</em> has been replaced by <em>org.apache.felix.scr</em>,
    which required a change in the dependency chain from <em>org.eclipse.equinox.util</em> to
    <em>org.eclipse.osgi.util</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>Eclipse Jetty</h2>

  <p>
    The target platform includes Jetty 9.4.0 instead of Jetty 9.3.x.
    This is not just a change of the version number, but the session handling was completely
    rewritten by the Jetty team. Please test your applications carefully and report if you find
    any problems.
  </p>

  <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>

  <h2><em>org.eclipse.rap.jface</em> indirectly requires Java 8</h2>

  <p>
    The underlying platform bundle <em>org.eclipse.equinox.common</em> now requires Java 8. The
    Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment (BREE) of "org.eclipse.rap.jface" bundle will be updated to
    <em>JavaSE-1.8</em> in the next milestone too.
