  <h2>Target Platform Changes</h2>

  <p>
    The target platform includes Jetty 9.4.0 instead of Jetty 9.3.x.
    This is not just a change of the version number, but the session handling was complete
    rewritten by Jetty team. Please test your applications carefully and report if you find any
    problems.
  </p>

  <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>

  <h2><em>org.eclipse.rap.jface</em> indirectly requires Java 8</h2>

  <p>
    The underlying platform bundle <em>org.eclipse.equinox.common</em> now requires Java 8. The
    Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment (BREE) of "org.eclipse.rap.jface" bundle will be updated to
    <em>JavaSE-1.8</em> in the next milestone too.
