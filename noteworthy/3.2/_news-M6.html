  <h2>ServerPush improvements</h2>

  <p>
    Using a timer to send ServerPush requests has been introduced as a workaround for
    <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=353819">Bug #353819</a>. As all recent
    WebKit browsers have this issue solved, the workaround is not needed anymore. More over, it
    causes some problems, because browsers delay the timers very agressively in background tabs.
