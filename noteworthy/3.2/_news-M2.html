  <h2>Possibility to change the maximum text-size storage size</h2>

  <p>
    The default maximum text-size storage size is set in the code to 10 000 entries. For most RAP
    applications this value is big enough. Nevertheless, there were few reports that
    exeeding this value will affect the application performance, as text-size-determination
    requests will be sent again and again. Now it's possible to change this value by setting a
    system property <code>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.textSizeStoreSize</code>.
