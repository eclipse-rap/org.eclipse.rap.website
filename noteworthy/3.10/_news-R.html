  <h3>Change minimal execution environment to Java 8</h3>

  <p>
    As many other Eclipse projects, we decided to raise the minimal execution environment to Java 8.
    We already had several projects that depend on platform bundles moved to Java 8. Using Java 8
    everywhere will make our life easier. We think that we won't exclude anyone by this move.

  <h3>New API</h3>

  <p>
    By using <code>ClientFileUploader</code> client service it was not possible to cancel an upload.
    That's especially a problem with slow network or very big uploads.
    <code>ClientFileUploader</code> service now has <code>abort(String)</code> method to cancel
    particular upload by it's id. The upload id is now returned by <code>submit</code> method.
    The new API is already utilized in <code>FileDialog</code> when the DND is used to upload
    files.
