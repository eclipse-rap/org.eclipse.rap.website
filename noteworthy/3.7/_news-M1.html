  <h2>Add support for upcoming Firefox 64+</h2>

  <p>
    For many years Firefox has been dispatching <code>keypress</code> events for non-printable keys,
    but other browsers not. This will change in one of the upcoming Firefox versions (probably 64.0
    scheduled for December). As a result, key navigation and selection in many RWT widgets like
    Tree, Table, List, and Combo will not function as expected. With a big help from Mozilla
    developers, we are ready with a fix in this milestone.
