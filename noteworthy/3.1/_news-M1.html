  <h2>Performance Improvements</h2>

  <p>
    Already in RAP 3.0, we've
    <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2015/06/25/rap-3-0-performance/">improved the performance</a>
    by optimizing the change detection.
    Now we've gone even further and introduced a new mechanism called <em>preserve-on-demand</em>
    that tracks changes to common widget properties and avoids data comparisons entirely for
    those properties that haven't been touched in the process of a request.
  </p>

  <p>
    With these changes, the server load and average response times in our load tests have
    again dropped significantly compared to RAP 3.0.

  <h2>FileDialog for dropped files</h2>

  <p>
    When files are dragged from the desktop and then dropped on a RAP widget, it's now possible to
    add these dropped files to a FileDialog in order to display upload progress and ask the user
    for confirmation.
    Thanks go out to Hannes Erven who contributed
    <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=471172">this feature</a>.

  <h2>Support for alpha in Color</h2>

  <p>
    Support for alpha in Color has been added to SWT in Mars. As RAP client supports RGBA natively,
    in this milestone we added the missing API:
    <ul>
      <li><code>RGBA</code> class</li>
      <li>constructor <code>Color(Device, RGBA)</code></li>
      <li>constructor <code>Color(Device, RGB, int)</code></li>
      <li>constructor <code>Color(Device, int, int, int, int)</code></li>
      <li><code>getAlpha()</code></li>
      <li><code>getRGBA()</code></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
