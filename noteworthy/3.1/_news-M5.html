  <h2>New Service Interface ClientFileLoader</h2>
  </p>
    Custom widgets often require their own CSS file to be loaded on the client.
    We already supported loading Javascript files using the <code>JavaScriptLoader</code> service,
    but we had no service to load CSS files.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we've introduced a new service interface named <code>ClientFileLoader</code> that can load
    both, JS and CSS files.
    The service provides two methods, <code>requireJs</code> and <code>requireCss</code>, that both
    accept a URL to load.
    The ClientFileLoader ensures that every file is loaded only once per session, so you can safely
    use it in the constructor of a custom widget.
  </p>
<pre lang="java">
ClientFileLoader loader = RWT.getClient().getService( ClientFileLoader.class );
loader.requireJs( JS_URL );
loader.requireCss( CSS_URL );
</pre>
  <p>
    This new service replaces the existing <code>JavaScriptLoader</code> service, which has been
    deprecated.
  </p>
