  <h2>Transformation Support for Canvas</h2>
  <p>
    <i>GC</i> now implements the <i>setTransform</i> method.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Column Span Support for Nebula Grid</h2>
  <p>
    <i>GridItem</i> now implements the <i>setColumnSpan</i> method. The Grid itself has been given
    a more spreadsheet-like default look to better work with this new feature. It is now also
    separately themeable (previously shared the a theme with Tree).   
  </p>
  
  <h2>Selection Theming update for all Table/List-based Widgets</h2>
  <p>
    <i>Tree</i>, <i>Table</i>, <i>Grid</i>, <i>List</i>, <i>Combo</i>, <i>CCombo</i> and 
    <i>DropDown</i> have a new default theming for selected items. Instead of a dark-blue gradient 
    a solid, semi-transparent light blue is used. This preserves the color of the text elements 
    (they are now longer set to white) and allows elements like cell backgrounds that are normally 
    hidden beneath the selection effect to shine through. It also works better with 
    the new Nebula Grid look. The business theme remains unchanged.
