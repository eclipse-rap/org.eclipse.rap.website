  <h2>Right-to-left support for some widgets</h2>

  <p>
    In this milestone we added support for right-to-left orientation in some widgets. Currently,
    the implementation is done for Shell, Button, (C)Combo, Composite, ScrolledComposite, Group,
    Slider, Tree, Table, ProgressBar, Spinner, Menu and TabFolder.
    This is a work in progress. We will extend the right-to-left support for other widgets in the
    next milestones.
