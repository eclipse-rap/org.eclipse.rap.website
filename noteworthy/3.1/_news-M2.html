  <h2>Right-to-left support</h2>

  <p>
    In this milestone we added support for right-to-left orientation. Currently, the implementation
    is done for Shell, Button, (C)Combo, Composite, ScrolledComposite, Group, Slider, Tree, Table,
    ProgressBar, Spinner, Menu and TabFolder. Like in SWT, the coordinate system of an RTL Composite
    is mirrored  horizontally (the [ 0, 0 ] point is on top-right corner).
    This is a work in progress. We will extend the right-to-left support for other widgets in the
    next milestones.
