  <h3>Support for entrypoints at the root path</h3>

  <p>
    Entrypoints in RAP are registered with a servlet path (e.g. “/example”).
    When deployed in a servlet container, every web application also has a context path.
    For example, a WAR file named “myapp.war” will lead to the context path “/myapp”
    This results in a URL like the following:
  </p>
<pre>
  http://example.com/myapp/example
</pre>
    It may be desirable to make the default entrypoint of an application directly available at the
    application's base URL:
<pre>
  http://example.com/myapp/
</pre>
  <p>
    To enable this pattern, entry points can now also be registered at the root path (“/”):
  </p>
<pre lang="java">
public class ExampleApplication implements ApplicationConfiguration {

  public void configure( Application application ) {
    application.addEntryPoint( "/", ExampleEntryPoint.class, null );
  }

}
</pre>
  <p>
    Please note that for RWT standalone, you should map the RWT servlet to the empty string
    (the path “/” is a special case in the servlet spec, it identifies the so-called
    <em>global</em> servlet).
  </p>
<pre lang="xml">
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;rwtServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;&lt;/url-pattern>
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</pre>

  <h3>Support for starting with HTTP POST</h3>

  <p>
    Since RAP 1.5, the RAP server required that the initial request to an application was made
    using the HTTP GET method. This request will be answered with the initial HTML page that loads
    the application.
    POST requests were reserved for Ajax calls that update the client's UI.
    Some users have reported that in certain restricted environments, it can be helpful to be able
    to start a RAP application with a POST request.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore we changed our policy and allow for RAP applications being accessed with a POST
    request again.
    However, please note that POST parameters sent with the initial request are not yet available
    to application code.
  </p>
