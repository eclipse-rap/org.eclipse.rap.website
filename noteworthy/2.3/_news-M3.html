  <h3>Support for Firefox 29+ and Chrome 33+</h3>

  <p>Recent changes in Firefox and Chrome required some adjustments in the WebClient.</p>

  <p>
    Due to changes in the <b>Firefox</b> API, RAP was no longer able to correctly identify Firefox 29.
    As a result, existing RAP application may not start (RAP <= 2.1) or may work only with
    glitches and errors (RAP 2.2). See <?=bug(433179)?>.
    This issue is fixed in M3. For older versions of RAP, please visit the
    <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/FAQ#Blank_page_or_client_crash_in_Firefox_29.2B">FAQ</a>
    for workarounds that you can apply yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently, a <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125070">bug</a> has been introduced
    in the WebKit engine, which is the basis for <b>Chrome, Safari and Opera</b>. This bug led to RAP UIs
    becoming partly invisible when a <i>Canvas</i> widget is used. See <?=bug(428717)?>.
    From this milestone on RAP works around this issue by using a different way to apply widget backgrounds.

  <h3>Migrated DropDown widget to RAP Core</h3>

  <p>
    The <i>DropDown</i> widget has been graduated from the RAP Incubator and is now included in the RAP
    core. It is basically a popup-list that can be attached to a Text widget. It simplifies
    implementing components similar to the JFace <i>FieldAssist</i>, but is significantly better
    suited for the RAP framework than <i>FieldAssist</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Incubator/DropDown"><i>AutoSuggest</i></a>
    component that builds on the <i>DropDown</i> widget is still in the same Incubator repository,
    but has been adjusted in the master branch/nightly builds to work with RAP 2.3. Take care not
    to include the old Incubator version of <i>DropDown</i> in your RAP 2.3 target, it may break
    the application.
  </p>

  <h3>Client-side (C)Combo rework</h3>

  <p>
    The JavaScript part of the <i>Combo</i> widget implementation has been completely
    rewritten. It now uses client-side <i>DropDown</i> implementation for it's list, allowing
    it to handle a much larger amount of items without performance degradation.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result it's now also possible to theme <i>Combo</i> list items independently.
    The <i>Combo-List-Item</i> CSS element supports <i>color</i>,
    <i>background-color</i>, <i>background-image</i>, <i>text-decoration</i>,
    <i>text-shadow</i> and <i>padding</i>.
