  <h3>Support for Firefox 29+ and Chrome 33+</h3>

  <p>Recent changes in Firefox and Chrome required some adjustments in the WebClient.</p>

  <p>
    Due to changes in the <b>Firefox</b> API, RAP was no longer able to correctly identify Firefox 29.
    As a result, existing RAP application may not start (RAP <= 2.1) or may work only with
    glitches and errors (RAP 2.2). See <?=bug(433179)?>.
    This issue is fixed in M3. For older versions of RAP, please visit the
    <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/FAQ#Blank_page_or_client_crash_in_Firefox_29.2B">FAQ</a>
    for workarounds that you can apply yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently, a <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125070">bug</a> has been introduced
    in the WebKit engine, which is the basis for <b>Chrome, Safari and Opera</b>. This bug led to RAP UIs
    becoming partly invisible when a <i>Canvas</i> widget is used. See <?=bug(428717)?>.
    From this milestone on RAP works around this issue by using a different way to apply widget backgrounds.

  <h3>Migrated DropDown widget to RAP Core</h3>

  <p>
    The <i>DropDown</i> widget has been graduated from the RAP Incubator and is now included in the RAP
    core. It is basically a popup-list that can be attached to a Text widget. It simplifies
    implementing components similar to the JFace <i>FieldAssist</i>, but is significantly better
    suited for the RAP framework than <i>FieldAssist</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Incubator/DropDown"><i>AutoSuggest</i></a>
    component that builds on the <i>DropDown</i> widget is still in the same Incubator repository,
    but has been adjusted in the master branch/nightly builds to work with RAP 2.3. Take care not
    to include the old Incubator version of <i>DropDown</i> in your RAP 2.3 target, it may break
    the application.
  </p>

  <h3>Client-side (C)Combo rework</h3>

  <p>
    The JavaScript part of the <i>Combo</i> widget implementation has been completely
    rewritten. It now uses client-side <i>DropDown</i> implementation for it's list, allowing
    it to handle a much larger amount of items without performance degradation.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result it's now also possible to theme <i>Combo</i> list items independently.
    The <i>Combo-List-Item</i> CSS element supports <i>color</i>,
    <i>background-color</i>, <i>background-image</i>, <i>text-decoration</i>,
    <i>text-shadow</i> and <i>padding</i>.
  </p>

  <h3>JavaScript API for Widget HTML manipulation</h3>

  <p>
    JavaScript widget objects obtained via <code>rap.getObject( id )</code> now have an
    field <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/doc/2.3/guide/reference/jsdoc/symbols/Widget.html#$el">"$el"</a> that allows manipulating their HTML element. Currently it can only be used to set
    HTML attributes, but this already makes it possible to assign test-id's for easier
    <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2014/04/29/how-to-write-ui-tests-for-rap-with-selenium-2-0/">UI-Testing</a>.
    It could also be used to add <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</a> attributes that can be evaluated by screen reader software.
  </p>

  <h3>New Incubator Project: e4 on RAP</h3>

  <p>
    Tom Schindl is working on <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2014/04/10/getting-started-with-eclipse4-applications-on-rap/">e4 support for RAP</a>,
    and the necessary additional components will (for now) live in <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/rap/incubator/org.eclipse.rap.incubator.e4.git/">this</a> RAP Incubator repository.
  </p>

  <h3>Heads up: Deprecation in lifecycle package</h3>

  <p>
    In an effort to remove the internals of the request processing (lifecycle and phases) from our
    public API, we are currently marking all API in the package <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.lifecycle</em>
    as deprecated.
    This includes lifecycle adapters (LCAs), phase listeners, and the class <code>WidgetUtil</code>.
    Most of this API is only relevant for custom widgets, and is replaced by the new API in the
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.remote</em> package
    (<code>RemoteObject</code>, <code>OperationHandler</code> etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    All deprecated API is still supported in 2.3 and will be removed in 3.0.
    We'll provide a migration guide that explains alternatives.
