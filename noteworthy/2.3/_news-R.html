  <h3>Updating from RAP 1.5 (Eclipse Juno)?</h3>

<h2>Widget Set</h2>

  <h3>Upload files using Drag&amp;Drop</h3>

  <p>
    You can now allow users to upload files from their desktop by dropping them onto a widget.
    To do so, use the SWT Drag&amp;Drop API with the transfer type
    <code>ClientFileTransfer</code>.
    The following example shows how to enable a Label to accept files:
  </p>

<pre lang="java">
Label dropLabel = new Label( parent, SWT.BORDER );
dropLabel.setText( &quot;Drop files here&quot; );
DropTarget dropTarget = new DropTarget( dropLabel, DND.DROP_MOVE );
dropTarget.setTransfer( new Transfer[]{ ClientFileTransfer.getInstance() } );
dropTarget.addDropListener( new DropTargetAdapter() {
  @Override
  public void drop( DropTargetEvent event ) {
    handleDroppedFiles( (ClientFile[])event.data );
  }
} );
</pre>

  <p>
    The <code>event.data</code> field will contain an array of <code>ClientFile</code>s, that
    provide information on the dropped files.
    It's an array because the user can also select and drag multiple files.
    To actually upload the dropped files, the new client service <code>ClientFileUploader</code>
    can be used:
  </p>

<pre>
ClientFileUploader uploader = RWT.getClient().getService( ClientFileUploader.class );
uploader.submit( uploadUrl, clientFiles );
</pre>

  <p>
    Finally, you have to accept and store the files on the server.
    The fileupload component in the <a href="http://eclipse.org/rap/incubator/">RAP Incubator</a>
    can be used to handle uploads in RAP easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>FileDialog</code>, also in the RAP Incubator, already uses the new API to provide
    support for dropped files out of the box.
  </p>

  <h3>Graduated DropDown widget from Incubator</h3>

  <p>
    The <em>DropDown</em> widget has been graduated from the RAP Incubator and is now included in RWT.
    It is basically a popup-list that can be attached to a Text widget and filled with selectable
    text items.
    This widget simplifies the implementation of auto-suggest components, similar to the JFace
    <em>FieldAssist</em>.
    Compared to FieldAssist, the DropDown is much better suited for RAP because of its
    client-side implementation.
  </p>

  <img class="framed" src="images/dropdown.png" />

  <p>
    If you're looking for a ready-to-use auto-suggest add-on you should consider the
    <em>AutoSuggest</em> component that builds on the <em>DropDown</em>.
    The AutoSuggest widget remains in the
    <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Incubator/DropDown">DropDown Incubator repository</a>,
    but it has been adjusted to work with RAP 2.3.
    Please make sure that you don't include the old Incubator version of <em>DropDown</em> in your
    RAP 2.3 target, as this may break your application.
  </p>

  <h3>Row Template supports percentage values</h3>

  <p>
    In the class <em>Cell</em> the methods <em>setLeft</em>, <em>setTop</em>, <em>setBottom</em>
    and <em>setRight</em> now all have an optional parameter <em>percentage</em> that accepts
    a float value between 0 and 100. The value is relative to the width/height of the row and is
    added to the given absolute pixel offset.
  </p>

  <h3>Client-side (C)Combo rework</h3>

  <p>
    The JavaScript part of the <em>Combo</em> widget implementation has been completely
    rewritten. It now uses the client-side <em>DropDown</em> implementation for it's list, allowing
    it to handle a much larger amount of items without performance degradation.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result, it's now also possible to apply an independent styling on <em>Combo</em> list items.
    The CSS element <em>Combo-List-Item</em> supports the properties <em>color</em>,
    <em>background-color</em>, <em>background-image</em>, <em>text-decoration</em>,
    <em>text-shadow</em> and <em>padding</em>.
  </p>

  <h3>JavaScript API for Widget HTML manipulation</h3>

  <p>
    JavaScript widget objects obtained via <code>rap.getObject( id )</code> now have a field
    <code><a href="http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/doc/2.3/guide/reference/jsdoc/symbols/Widget.html#$el">$el</a></code>
    that represents the widget's HTML element and allows to manipulate it.
    Text widgets have an additional <code>$input</code> field that represents their &lt;input&gt;
    element. Examples:
  </p>
<pre lang="javascript">
button.$el.attr( 'test-id', 'submit-button' );
field1.$input.attr( 'test-id', 'username-text-input' );
</pre>
  <p>
    Currently, these fields can only be used to set HTML attributes, but this already makes it
    possible to assign test-ids for easier
    <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2014/04/29/how-to-write-ui-tests-for-rap-with-selenium-2-0/">UI-Testing</a>.
    This API could also be used to add
    <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2014/05/28/rap-and-accessibility-screen-reader/">ARIA</a>
    attributes that can be evaluated by screen reader software.
  </p>

  <h2>Browser Support</h2>

  <h3>Firefox 29+ Detection</h3>

  <p>
    Due to changes in the <strong>Firefox</strong> API, RAP 2.2 and earlier was no longer able to correctly
    identify Firefox 29. As a result, existing RAP applications may crash or not start at all.
    This issue is fixed in 2.3. For older versions of RAP, please visit the
    <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/FAQ#Blank_page_or_client_crash_in_Firefox_29.2B">FAQ</a>
    for workarounds that you can apply yourself.
  </p>

  <h3>Webkit/Chrome 33+ glitch solved</h3>

  <p>
    Recently, a <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125070">bug</a> has been introduced
    in the WebKit engine, which is the basis for <strong>Chrome, Safari and Opera</strong>. This bug led to
    RAP UIs becoming partly invisible when a <em>Canvas</em> widget or certain custom widgets are
    on screen. RAP now works around this issue by using a different way to apply widget backgrounds.
    For older versions of RAP, please visit the
    <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/FAQ#Widgets_disappearing_in_Google_Chrome.2C_Safari_or_Opera">FAQ</a>
    for workarounds that you can apply yourself.
  </p>

  <h3>Heads up: No IE8 support in upcoming RAP 3.0</h3>

  <p>
    The RAP 2.3.x versions will be the last to support Internet Explorer 7 and 8.
    We currently plan to release RAP 3.0 in Dec 2014 with a minimum requirement of version 9 or later
    for Internet Explorer. The minimum versions for other browser will likely be raised as well.
    This will allow us to clean up a lot of old code and concentrate more on HTML5/CSS3 based
    features not possible with older browsers.
  </p>

  <h2>Application Development</h2>

  <h3>New Incubator Project: E4 on RAP</h3>

  <p>
    It's now possible to run <strong>Eclipse 4 applications on RAP</strong>.
    To do so, you need some extra bundles in your target platform that currently live in the
    <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/rap/incubator/org.eclipse.rap.incubator.e4.git/">rap-e4 incubator repository</a>.
    This incubator component is maintained by Tom Schindl.
    For the details, please check out Tom's
    <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2014/04/10/getting-started-with-eclipse4-applications-on-rap/">blog post</a>.
  </p>

  <img class="framed" src="images/e4-events.png" />

  <h3>Heads up: Deprecation in lifecycle package</h3>

  <p>
    In an effort to remove the internals of the request processing (lifecycle and phases) from our
    public API, we've marked all API in the package <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.lifecycle</em>
    as deprecated.
    This includes lifecycle adapters (LCAs), phase listeners, and the class <code>WidgetUtil</code>.
    Most of this API is only relevant for custom widgets, and is replaced by the new API in the
    package <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.remote</em>
    (<code>RemoteObject</code>, <code>OperationHandler</code> etc.).
    The class <code>WidgetUtil</code> is replaced by a stripped-down copy in
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.widgets</em>.
    PhaseListeners are going to be replaced by MessageFilters.
    This new API is still internal and will be published in 3.0.
  </p>
  <p>
    All deprecated API is still supported in 2.3 and will be removed in 3.0.
    We'll provide a migration guide that explains alternatives.
  </p>

  <h3>New API for Singletons</h3>

  <p>
    We already provide the class <em>SingletonUtil</em> to facilitate the conversion of classic
    singletons to UISession-scoped singletons for use in RAP's multi-user environment.
    This class has a new method named <em>getUniqueInstance</em> that accepts a UISession instance
    as a parameter. You can obtain a unique instance of a given class for the current UISession like so:
  </p>

<pre lang="java">
public static MySingleton getInstance() {
  UISession uiSession = RWT.getUISession();
  return SingletonUtil.getUniqueInstance( MySingleton.class, uiSession );
}
</pre>

  <p>
    In this case, the method is equivalent to the existing method <code>getSessionInstance(Class)</code>.
    However, with the additional parameter, it allows you to obtain the singleton instance
    for a given UISession <em>even from another thread</em> without having to wrap your code
    in a runnable and pass it to <code>uiSession.exec()</code>.
    To prepare your singleton for access from background threads, you may consider adding a
    parameter to the getInstance method as shown below.
    Avoiding the static access to the UISession also helps to write better unit tests.
  </p>

<pre lang="java">
private static MySingleton getInstance( UISession uiSession ) {
  return SingletonUtil.getUniqueInstance( MySingleton.class, uiSession );
}
</pre>

  <p>
    The old method <code>getSessionInstance()</code> still exists and delegates to the new one,
    so you should be able to adjust your code using an “Inline Method” refactoring.
  </p>

  <h3>Support for Application Singletons</h3>

  <p>
    Similar to UISession singletons, you can now also create singletons with application scope.
    Whenever you run multiple RAP applications in a single VM, there may be classes in a shared
    bundle that should have exactly one instance per application.
  </p>

<pre lang="java">
ApplicationContext context = RWT.getApplicationContext();
SingletonUtil.getUniqueInstance( MySingleton.class, applicationContext );
</pre>

  <h3>Support for entrypoints at the root path</h3>

  <p>
    Entrypoints in RAP are registered with a servlet path (e.g. “/example”).
    When deployed in a servlet container, every web application also has a context path.
    For example, a WAR file named “myapp.war” will lead to the context path
    “/myapp” This results in a URL like the following:
  </p>
<pre>
http://example.com/myapp/example
</pre>
  <p>
    It may be desirable to make the default entrypoint of an application directly available at the
    application's base URL:
  </p>
<pre>
http://example.com/myapp/
</pre>
  <p>
    To enable this pattern, entry points can now also be registered at the root path (“/”):
  </p>
<pre lang="java">
public class ExampleApplication implements ApplicationConfiguration {

  public void configure( Application application ) {
    application.addEntryPoint( &quot;/&quot;, ExampleEntryPoint.class, null );
  }

}
</pre>
  <p>
    Please note that for RWT standalone, you should map the RWT servlet to the empty string
    (the path “/” is a special case in the servlet spec, it identifies the so-called
    <em>global</em> servlet).
  </p>
<pre lang="xml">
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;rwtServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;&lt;/url-pattern>
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</pre>

  <h3>Support for starting with HTTP POST</h3>

  <p>
    Since RAP 1.5, the RAP server required that the initial request to an application was made
    using the HTTP GET method. Some users have reported that in certain restricted environments,
    it can be helpful to be able to start a RAP application with a POST request.
    Therefore we changed our policy and allow for RAP applications being accessed with a POST
    request again.
  </p>
