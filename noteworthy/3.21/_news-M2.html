    <h2>Migration to GitHub</h2>

    <p>
        The Eclipse RAP project is now using GitHub for source code and issue tracking instead of
        Gerrit and Bugzilla.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of Gerrit, we will do our development via GitHub from now on. Under the new
        <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-rap/">Eclipse RAP organisation</a>, the previous Git
        repositories with all branches and tags can now be found there, whereby the main development
        is now done in the <code>main</code> instead of the <code>master</code> branch. The old
        Gerrit repositories will remain in read-only mode and will no longer be updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same applies to issue tracking: For our future work we will use GitHub issues only.
        Old bugs remain in Bugzilla, but new ones should only be created as GitHub issues for the
        Eclipse RAP projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        All relevant build jobs have been updated, our dedicated
        <a href="https://ci.eclipse.org/rap/view/RAP%20main%20branch/">Jenkins instance</a>
        remains the same as before.
    </p>
