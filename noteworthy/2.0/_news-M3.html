  <h2>New Web Client Services</h2>
  <p>
    Based on the new Client API that has been introduced in M2, some existing API has been
    transformed into client services.
  </p>

  <h3>JavaScriptExecutor service</h3>
  <p>
    This service can be used to execute a piece of JavaScript code on the client.
    It replaces the internal class <em>JSExecutor</em>. Example:
  </p>
<pre>
  JavaScriptExecutor executer = RWT.getClient().getService( JavaScriptExecutor.class );
  executer.execute( "alert( \"Hello World!\" );" );
</pre>

  <h3>BrowserHistory service</h3>
  <p>
    Allows to use the browser's history for navigating within the application.
    The previous <em>IBrowserHistory</em> interface has been deprecated. Example:
  </p>
<pre>
  BrowserHistory history = RWT.getClient().getService( BrowserHistory.class );
  history.createEntry( "main", "Main View" );
</pre>

  <h3>ExitConfirmation service</h3>
  <p>
    Configure the confirmation dialog that can be shown before the user leaves the application.
    It is no longer possible to do this via the branding API. Example:
  </p>
<pre>
  ExitConfirmation exitConfirmation = RWT.getClient().getService( ExitConfirmation.class );
  exitConfirmation.setMessage( "Where do you think you're going?!" );
</pre>

  <h2>New Event System</h2>
  <p>
    The event system in RWT has been completely re-written.
    For historical reasons, the implementation was based on typed events like SelectionEvent with untyped
    events built on top.
    This inverted design caused several problems that are now fixed.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the new implementation, the design follows the structure of SWT.
    Typed and untyped events work exactly like in the original.
    This also allowed us to provide some missing API:
    All typed events have a <code>time</code> field that reflects the time an event has occurred.
    MouseEvent has a field <code>count</code> that allows to distinguish single and double clicks.
    Custom widgets can now use the protected method
    <code>Widget #removeListener( int, SWTEventListener )</code>.
  </p>
