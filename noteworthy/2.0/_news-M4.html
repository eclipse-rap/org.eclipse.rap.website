  <h2>API Changes</h2>

  <h3>Class Graphics deprecated</h3>
  <p>
    The class <em>Graphics</em> had been used to create <em>shared</em> instances of resources like
    <em>Color</em> and <em>Font</em> before resource constructors were introduced in 1.3.
    This practice is problematic because instances created using these methods throw an exception
    when trying to dispose them. Moreover, they cannot be garbage collected.
    In RAP 2.0, resources should only be created using the constructors
    of <em>Color</em>, <em>Font</em>, <em>Cursor</em>, and <em>Image</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graphics also provided methods for test size measurement. We expect that these methods are
    hardly used by application code and can be replaced by SWT's <em>GC</em> API.
    To measure a string in a given font, create a GC, set the font, and call the GC methods
    <em>stringExtent</em> or <em>textExtent</em>. Don't forget to dispose of the GC afterwards.
  </p>

  <h3>I-prefixed Interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    The prefix “I” in interface names like <em>IEntryPoint</em> is a heritage from the Eclipse
    platform.
    This deviates from the naming pattern used in SWT and other libraries, and also from the Java
    class library.
    Since it is not even used consistently in RAP, we're removing the prefix from all interfaces.
  </p>

  <h3>Service handlers</h3>
  <p>
    The interface <em>ServiceHandler</em> has been changed.
    The <em>service</em> method now provides two parameters <em>request</em> and <em>response</em>
    to the implementation.
    Developers don't have to obtain the request and reponse objects from static methods anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>ServiceManager</em> has got a new method <em>getServiceHandlerUrl( String )</em>.
    Developers should use this new method to obtain the URL to access a service handler instead
    of assembling the URL manually.
  </p>

  <h2>Settings</h2>

  <h3>Development Mode</h3>
  <p>
    During development, it's recommended to start RAP in </en>development mode</en>.
    In this mode, the JavaScript for the web client is not compressed and potential client-side
    errors will not be caught.
    This new setting replaces the old <em>clientLibraryVersion</em>, which has been used for this
    purpose before.
    In the RAP Launcher, you'll find a new option to enable the development mode:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="framed" title="Development mode" src="images/RAPLauncher-dev-mode.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    In OSGi launch configurations, please replace the VM parameter
    <code>-Dorg.eclipse.rwt.clientLibraryVersion=DEBUG</code> with
    <code>-Dorg.eclipse.rap.rwt.developmentMode=true</code>.
  </p>
