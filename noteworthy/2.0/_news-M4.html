  <h2>API Changes</h2>

  <h3>Class Graphics deprecated</h3>
  <p>
    The class <em>Graphics</em> had been used to create <em>shared</em> instances of resources like
    <em>Color</em> and <em>Font</em> before resource constructors were introduced in 1.3.
    This practice is problematic because instances created using these methods throw an exception
    when trying to dispose them. Moreover, they cannot be garbage collected.
    In RAP 2.0, resources should only be created using the constructors
    of <em>Color</em>, <em>Font</em>, <em>Cursor</em>, and <em>Image</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graphics also provided methods for test size measurement. We expect that these methods are
    hardly used by application code and can be replaced by SWT's <em>GC</em> API.
    To measure a string in a given font, create a GC, set the font, and call the GC methods
    <em>stringExtent</em> or <em>textExtent</em>. Don't forget to dispose of the GC afterwards.
