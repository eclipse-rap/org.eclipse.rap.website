  <h2>New Java API for Custom Widgets</h2>
  <p>
    With RAP 2.0, it's becoming a lot easier to write custom widgets or other add-ons for RAP.
    We have published a new Java API to synchronize server-side objects with their related objects
    on the client.
    This API is built on the new RAP protocol and it lets you send updates directly to the client
    (and receive updates from the client in turn) without diving too deep into RAP's internals.
    In particular, you don't have to write any so-called LifeCycleAdapters (LCAs) anymore.
  </p>

  <h3>RemoteObject</h3>
  <p>
    The central interface, called <em>RemoteObject</em>, is used to communicate with the client-side
    counterpart of an object, the <em>remote</em> object.
    First you need to create this object, then you can start sending updates to it
    by simply calling the remote object's <em>set</em>, <em>call</em>, etc. methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following snippet shows how to create a remote object of the type
    <em>example.CoffeeMachine</em> and set the property <em>sugar</em> to the value <em>false</em>.
    That's all there is to do to create the object on the client and set a property on it.
    The framework will render a <em>create</em> operation to the client.
  </p>
<pre>
Connection connection = RWT.getUISession().getConnection();
RemoteObject remoteObject = connection.createRemoteObject( "example.CoffeeMachine" );
remoteObject.set( "sugar", false );
</pre>

  <h3>OperationHandler</h3>
  <p>
    To receive updates from the client, you have to add an operation handler to the remote object.
    This operation handler has <em>handleXxx</em> methods for all relevant protocol operations.
  </p>
<pre>
remoteObject.setHandler( new AbstractOperationHandler() {

  @Override
  public void handleNotify( String event, Map<String, Object> properties ) {
    // react on the event, notify listeners ...
  }
} );
</pre>

  <p>
    The new API lives in the package <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.remote</em>.
    It's still considered provisional, but already used by a couple of widgets and services in RAP
    itself.
    It's expected to evolve over the next release, but we don't expect big changes.
  </p>

  <h2>Simplified EntryPoints</h2>
  <p>
    To reduce the code required to implement an <em>EntryPoint</em>, we provide an abstract base
    class called <em>AbstractEntryPoint</em> with a skeletal implementation of the interface.
    It creates a display and a main shell and starts the SWT event loop when in SWT mode,
    you don't have to care for these things anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend to use this base class for all entrypoints rather than implementing the interface
    itself.
    The following code snippet shows a minimal but complete entry point:
  </p>
<pre lang="java">
public class HelloEntryPoint extends AbstractEntryPoint {

  @Override
  protected void createContents( Composite parent ) {
    parent.setLayout( new GridLayout() );
    Button button = new Button( parent, SWT.PUSH );
    button.setText( "Hello World!" );
  }
}
</pre>
  <p>
    The main shell is full-screen by default, but this can be changed by overriding another method,
    <em>createShell()</em>.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>RAP Tools</h2>

  <h3>RWT Launcher</h3>
  <p>
    The RWT Launcher has got new options to configure the session timeout and the context path,
    just like the RAP Launcher.
  </p>

  <h3>New Basic Template</h3>
  <p>
    To help getting started with a minimal Hello World application, we added a new very basic
    template to the RAP Tools.
    This template uses an ApplicationConfiguration, registered using declarative services,
    instead of workbench extension points.
