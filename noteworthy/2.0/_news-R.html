  <h2>API Changes</h2>

  <p>
    With the move to RAP 2.0, we are cleaning up our APIs.
    This will lead to breaking changes.
    Existing RAP 1.x applications will therefore need minor adjustments to work with RAP 2.0.
    See the <a href="migration-guide/">RAP 2.0 Migration Guide</a> for instructions on updating
    your code to RAP 2.0.

  <h3>Package org.eclipse.rwt renamed</h3>

  <p>
    We renamed this package to org.eclipse.rap.rwt in order to comply with Eclipse naming
    convention that packages should be prefixed with the project that creates it.
