  <h2>API Changes</h2>

  <p>
    With the move to RAP 2.0, we are cleaning up our APIs.
    This will lead to breaking changes.
    Existing RAP 1.x applications will therefore need minor adjustments to work with RAP 2.0.
    See the <a href="migration-guide/">RAP 2.0 Migration Guide</a> for instructions on updating
    your code to RAP 2.0.
  </p>

  <h3>Package org.eclipse.rwt renamed</h3>

  <p>
    We renamed this package to org.eclipse.rap.rwt in order to comply with Eclipse naming
    convention that packages should be prefixed with the project that creates it.
  </p>

  <h3>Constant WidgetUtil.CUSTOM_VARIANT moved</h3>

  <p>
    This constant has been moved to the class RWT.
  </p>

  <h3>Deprecated public classes and methods removed</h3>

  <p>
    With the new JSON-based protocol in place the old deprecated classes and methods for rendering 
    JavaScript are now obsolete. JSWrite, JSVar, JSListenerType and JSListenerInfo classes have been 
    removed together with the corresponding methods in WidgetLCAUtil and ControlLCAUtil.
  </p>

  <h2>Widget Set</h2>

  <h3>Touch-Scrolling for Tree and Table</h3>

  <p>
    Tree and Table widgets can now be scrolled on mobile devices (iOS and Android) by dragging a row 
    with one finger. However, Tree and Table can only scroll item-by-item, not smooth as like the 
    List.
  </p>

  	Text widget now have full support for SWT.ICON_SEARCH and SWT.ICON_CANCEL style flags.
