  <h2>API Changes</h2>

  <p>
    With the move to RAP 2.0, we are cleaning up our APIs.
    This will lead to breaking changes.
    Existing RAP 1.x applications will therefore need minor adjustments to work with RAP 2.0.
    See the <a href="migration-guide/">RAP 2.0 Migration Guide</a> for instructions on updating
    your code to RAP 2.0.
  </p>

  <h3>Package org.eclipse.rwt renamed</h3>

  <p>
    We renamed this package to org.eclipse.rap.rwt in order to comply with Eclipse naming
    convention that packages should be prefixed with the project that creates it.
  </p>

  <h3>Constant WidgetUtil.CUSTOM_VARIANT moved</h3>

  <p>
    This constant has been moved to the class RWT.
  </p>

  <h3>Deprecated public classes and methods removed</h3>

  <p>
    With the new JSON-based protocol in place the old deprecated classes and methods for rendering
    JavaScript are now obsolete. JSWrite, JSVar, JSListenerType and JSListenerInfo classes have been
    removed together with the corresponding methods in WidgetLCAUtil and ControlLCAUtil.
  </p>

  <h2>Widget Set</h2>

  <h3>Touch-Scrolling for Tree and Table</h3>

  <p>
    Tree and Table widgets can now be scrolled on mobile devices (iOS and Android) by dragging a row
    with one finger. However, Tree and Table can only scroll item-by-item, not smooth as like the
    List.
  </p>

  <h3>SWT.ICON_SEARCH and SWT.ICON_CANCEL support for Text widget</h3>

  <p>
    Text widget now have full support for SWT.ICON_SEARCH and SWT.ICON_CANCEL style flags.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Themeing enhancements</h3>

  <p>
    The themeablity of some widgets has been improved. The following properties and states have been 
    added:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>box-shadow</code> property for DateTime
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>hover</code> state and <code>text-decoration</code> property for List-Hyperlink
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>text-decoration</code> property for Button
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>disabled</code> state for Combo-Button-Icon
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tools</h2>

  <h3>RAP Launcher always terminates previous launch</h3>
  <p>
    The RAP launcher has an option to terminate an already running application before starting a
    new one. This turned out to be a valuable feature, particularly when working with fixed ports.
    We couldn't find a good reason to ever disable this functionality, so we decided to remove the
    option from the launcher while keeping the default behavior.

  <h2>Network / Communication</h2>

  <h3>Client-to-server JSON-based protocol</h3>

  <p>
    In 1.5 we replaced the communication between server and client with a new, JSON-based format.
    Now, the client also sends it's changes in the same way - no request properties involved 
    anymore. All widgets LCAs have been refactored to handle the new JSON-based message.
  </p>

  <p>
    The exact format is described in the
    <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Protocol">RAP Protocol wiki page</a>.
