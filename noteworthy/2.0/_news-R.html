  <h2>Network / Communication</h2>

  <p>
    In 1.5 we replaced the communication between server and client with a new, JSON-based format.
    In 2.0, the client uses the same format to report changes to the server.
    With this change, the entire communication uses the JSON protocol.
    No HTTP request parameters are involved anymore.
    All widgets LCAs have been reworked to handle the new JSON-based message.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="framed" src="images/Client-to-server-JSON.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The exact format is described in the
    <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Protocol">RAP Protocol wiki page</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>New Java API for Custom Widgets</h2>
  <p>
    With RAP 2.0, it's becoming a lot easier to write custom widgets or other add-ons for RAP.
    We've published a new Java API to synchronize server-side objects with their related objects
    on the client.
    This API is built on the new <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Protocol">RAP protocol</a>
    and it lets you send updates directly to the client
    (and receive updates from the client in turn) without diving too deep into RAP's internals.
    In particular, you don't have to write any so-called LifeCycleAdapters (LCAs) anymore.
  </p>

  <h3>RemoteObject</h3>
  <p>
    The central interface, called <em>RemoteObject</em>, is used to communicate with the client-side
    counterpart of an object, the <em>remote</em> object.
    First you need to create this object, then you can start sending updates to it
    by simply calling the remote object's <em>set</em>, <em>call</em>, etc. methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following snippet shows how to create a remote object of the type
    <em>example.CoffeeMachine</em> and set the property <em>sugar</em> to the value <em>false</em>.
    That's all there is to do to send a <em>create</em> operation to the client with the initial
    property included.
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
Connection connection = RWT.getUISession().getConnection();
RemoteObject remoteObject = connection.createRemoteObject( "example.CoffeeMachine" );
remoteObject.set( "sugar", false );
</pre>

  <h3>OperationHandler</h3>
  <p>
    To receive updates from the client, you have to add an operation handler to the remote object.
    This operation handler has <em>handle…</em> methods for all relevant protocol operations.
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
remoteObject.setHandler( new AbstractOperationHandler() {

  @Override
  public void handleNotify( String event, Map<String, Object> properties ) {
    // react on the event, notify listeners ...
  }
} );
</pre>

  <p>
    The new API lives in the package <em>org.eclipse.rap.rwt.remote</em>.
    It's still considered provisional, but already used by a couple of widgets and services in RAP
    itself.
    It's expected to evolve over the next release, but we don't expect big changes.
  </p>

  <h2>New JavaScript API for Custom Widgets</h2>
  <p>
    For the first time ever, RAP provides public JavaScript API.
    There's now an object named <em>rap</em> in the global namespace of the JavaScript client.
    All methods contained in this object are documented in the
    <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/doc/2.0/guide/reference/jsdoc/index.html">RAP API reference</a>
    together with their return types.
    The most important methods are <em>registerTypeHandler</em> and <em>getRemoteObject</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This API can also be used in JavaScript code added by the JavaScriptLoader, the
    JavaScriptExecutor, or the ClientScripting add-on.
  </p>

  <h3>Registering type handler</h3>
  <p>
    A type handler defines how protocol messages for a specific <em>type</em> should be handled.
    At minimum it defines a <em>factory</em> function that is used to create an object of this type
    when the server sends a <em>create</em> operation.
    It can also define the name of a <em>destructor</em> function, and a list of supported
    <em>properties</em>, <em>events</em> and <em>methods</em>.
    A typical type handler might look like this:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-js">
rap.registerTypeHandler( "example.CoffeeMachine", {

  factory : function( properties ) {
    return new CoffeeMachine( properties );
  },

  destructor : "dispose",

  properties : [ "sugar", "power" ],

  events : [ "Ready" ]

} );
</pre>
  <p>
    The created object is stored by the framework under its object id.
    This object has to implement setter methods that match the properties defined in the handler,
    which will then be called when the server sends a <em>set</em> operation for a given property.
  </p>
  <h3>Remote Object (client)</h3>
  <p>
    Just like the server, the client provides a <em>RemoteObject</em> that represents the
    server-side counterpart of a client object. It has a very similar API, with <em>set</em>,
    <em>call</em> and <em>notify</em> methods.
    If, for example, the custom widget wishes to inform the server that the value of the property
    <em>text</em> changed, it could look like this:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-js">
var remoteObject = rap.getRemoteObject( this );
remoteObject.set( "text", this.getText() );
remoteObject.notify( "Modify" );
</pre>

  <h2>New Client API</h2>

  <p>
    Now that alternative clients can be connected to a RAP server, applications will need to
    distinguish between different clients, e.g. to render parts differently on certain clients.
  </p>

  <p>
    To support those cases, we added a service provider interface <em>Client</em> that can be
    acquired using the new method <em>RWT.getClient()</em>. Unless you have a custom client
    implementation installed, <em>RWT.getClient()</em> will always return an instance of
    <em>WebClient</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Client implementations can provide client-specific services, which can be obtained using the
    method <em>getService( Class<T> type )</em>. Some existing API has been transformed into
    services of the <em>WebClient</em>.
  </p>

  <h3>JavaScriptExecutor service</h3>
  <p>
    This service can be used to execute a piece of JavaScript code on the client.
    It replaces the internal class <em>JSExecutor</em>. Example:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
JavaScriptExecutor executor = RWT.getClient().getService( JavaScriptExecutor.class );
executor.execute( "alert( \"Hello World!\" );" );
</pre>

  <h3>JavaScriptLoader service</h3>
  <p>
    If a custom component requires additional JavaScript code on the client, the JavaScriptLoader
    can be used to load a JavaScript file just before the component uses it.
    The JavaScriptLoader will ensure that the file is loaded only once, even if <em>require()</em>
    is called subsequently.
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
JavaScriptLoader loader = RWT.getClient().getService( JavaScriptLoader.class );
loader.require( "rwt-resources/myComponent/MyFile.js" );
</pre>

  <h3>ClientInfo service</h3>
  <p>
    The ClientInfo service provides additional information about the client that is connected to the
    current UI session.
    In this version, the service provides the client's locale and its timezone offset in minutes.
    Unfortunately, it's not possible to obtain the actual timezone region from the browser.
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
ClientInfo clientInfo = RWT.getClient().getService( ClientInfo.class );
int timezoneOffset = clientInfo.getTimezoneOffset();
Locale clientLocale = clientInfo.getLocale();
</pre>

  <h3>UrlLauncher service</h3>
  <p>
    The UrlLauncher service allows to open any URL (websites, files, "mailto", etc.) without
    influencing or leaving the application. Popup blocker may ask the user for permission before
    a new window is opened.
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
UrlLauncher launcher = RWT.getClient().getService( UrlLauncher.class );
launcher.openURL( "http://www.eclipse.org/" );
launcher.openURL( "mailto:someone@nowhere.org" );
</pre>
  <p>
    Please use this new client service instead of the deprecated <em>ExternalBrowser</em>.
  </p>

  <h3>BrowserNavigation service</h3>
  <p>
    The BrowserNavigation service provides support for the browser's back/forward buttons and
    deep linking. It's a complete replacement for the removed class BrowserHistory.
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
BrowserNavigation navigation = RWT.getClient().getService( BrowserNavigation.class );
navigation.pushState( "main", "Main View" );
</pre>

  <h3>ExitConfirmation service</h3>
  <p>
    Used to configure the confirmation dialog that can be shown before the user leaves the
    application.
    It is no longer possible to do this in a branding. Example:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
ExitConfirmation confirmation = RWT.getClient().getService( ExitConfirmation.class );
confirmation.setMessage( "Where do you think you're going?!" );
</pre>

  <h2>Widget Set</h2>

  <h3>Touch-Scrolling for Tree and Table</h3>

  <p>
    Tree and Table widgets can now be scrolled on mobile devices (iOS and Android) by dragging a row
    with one finger. However, Tree and Table can only scroll item-by-item, not smooth like the
    List.
  </p>

  <h3>SWT.ICON_SEARCH and SWT.ICON_CANCEL support for Text widget</h3>

  <p>
    Text widget now have full support for SWT.ICON_SEARCH and SWT.ICON_CANCEL style flags.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="framed" title="Text with search icons" src="images/Text-Search-Icons.png" />
  </p>

  <h3>Theming enhancements</h3>

  <p>
    The themeablity of some widgets has been improved. The following properties and states have been
    added:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>box-shadow</code> property for DateTime
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>hover</code> state and <code>text-decoration</code> property for List-Hyperlink
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>text-decoration</code> property for Button
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>disabled</code> state for Combo-Button-Icon
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>New Event System</h3>
  <p>
    The event system in RWT has been completely re-written.
    For historical reasons, the implementation was based on typed events like SelectionEvent
    with untyped events built on top. This caused several problems that are now fixed (see <?=bug(334028)?>).
  </p>
  <p>
    This also allowed us to provide some missing API:
    All typed events have a <code>time</code> field that reflects the time an event has occurred.
    MouseEvent has a field <code>count</code> that allows to distinguish single and double clicks.
    Custom widgets can now use the protected method
    <code>Widget #removeListener( int, SWTEventListener )</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>API Changes</h2>

  <p>
    With the move to RAP 2.0, we are cleaning up our APIs.
    This will lead to breaking changes.
    Existing RAP 1.x applications will therefore need minor adjustments to work with RAP 2.0.
    See the <a href="migration-guide/">RAP 2.0 Migration Guide</a> for instructions on updating
    your code to RAP 2.0.
  </p>

  <h3>Package org.eclipse.rwt renamed</h3>

  <p>
    We renamed this package to org.eclipse.rap.rwt in order to comply with Eclipse naming
    convention that packages should be prefixed with the project that creates it.
  </p>

  <h3>Constant WidgetUtil.CUSTOM_VARIANT moved</h3>

  <p>
    This constant has been moved to the class RWT.
  </p>

  <h3>Prefix “I” removed from interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    The prefix “I” in interface names like <em>IEntryPoint</em> is a heritage from the Eclipse
    platform.
    This deviates from the naming pattern used in SWT and other libraries, and also from the Java
    class library.
    Since it is not even used consistently in RAP, we're removing the prefix from all interfaces.
  </p>

  <h3>Deprecated public classes and methods removed</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt>JSWriter, JSVar, JSListenerType, JSListenerInfo</dt>
    <dd>
      removed together with the corresponding methods in WidgetLCAUtil and ControlLCAUtil.
      These classes were used for rendering JavaScript are now obsolete.
    </dd>
    <dt>AdapterFactory</dt>
    <dd>
      removed without a replacement together with the extension point,
      see <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=344541">bug 344541</a>
    </dd>
    <dt>ResourceManagerFactory</dt>
    <dd>
      remove without a replacement,
      see <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=348476">bug 348476</a>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Graphics deprecated</h3>
  <p>
    The class <em>Graphics</em> had been used to create <em>shared</em> instances of resources like
    <em>Color</em> and <em>Font</em> before resource constructors were introduced in 1.3.
    This practice is problematic because instances created using these methods throw an exception
    when trying to dispose them. Moreover, they cannot be garbage collected.
    In RAP 2.0, resources should only be created using the constructors
    of <em>Color</em>, <em>Font</em>, <em>Cursor</em>, and <em>Image</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graphics also provided methods for test size measurement. We expect that these methods are
    hardly used by application code and can be replaced by SWT's <em>GC</em> API.
    To measure a string in a given font, create a GC, set the font, and call the GC methods
    <em>stringExtent</em> or <em>textExtent</em>. Don't forget to dispose of the GC afterwards.
  </p>

  <h3>Service store deprecated</h3>
  <p>
    The service store is used internally by the framework to store data in the scope of a request.
    Application developers shouldn't really need this store anymore.
    If an application needs to store any information in the request scope, it should use the
    request object directly, i.e. <code>RWT.getRequest().setAttribute(...)</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Session store replaced by UI session</h3>
  <p>
    When working with RAP, you have to deal with two different types of sessions: the servlet
    container's <em>HttpSession</em> and RAP's <em>UISession</em> (formerly known as session store).
    Both sessions have a different scope and a different purpose.
    In recent projects we've noticed that the relationship between the HTTP session and RAP's
    “session store” led to confusion. By renaming the session store to UI session we hope to make it
    more clear that both are sessions with a different scope and meaning.
    Here's some background:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The HTTP session</strong> is managed by the servlet container which recognizes the user
    with the help of a Cookie or URL rewriting.
    It has a configurable timeout, after which a user has to sign in again.
    The HTTP session is the place to store user-specific information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The UI session</strong> is built on top of the HTTP session, but has a shorter lifetime.
    A new UI session is started every time a user accesses an entrypoint and it lives as long this
    UI is being used. When the user accesses another entrypoint, this results in a new UISession,
    but the HttpSession will be the same.
    The UI session is the place to store information that is related to the current
    <em>instance</em> of an application's UI.
    It can now also be used to access UI-session-scoped instances such as the <em>Client</em>
    and the locale.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interface <em>ISessionStore</em> has been renamed to <em>UISession</em>. The types
    <em>SessionStoreListener</em> and <em>SessionStoreEvent</em> have been renamed accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the <em>get/setAttribute</em> methods, <em>UISession</em> also provides access
    to the <code>Client</code> instance and the <code>Locale</code>.
    Actually, <code>RWT.getClient()</code> is now a shortcut for
    <code>RWT.getUISession().getClient()</code>.
    The same is true for <code>RWT.getLocale()</code> and <code>RWT.setLocale( locale )</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>New Server Push API to replace UICallBack</h3>
  <p>
    The class <em>UICallBack</em> represents RAP's mechanism to “push” UI updates to the client
    when these updates occur outside of a request.
    It can be activated and deactivated using an ID, in order to allow different parties to activate
    the the push independently.
    We noticed that users had trouble to understand the idea behind these IDs,
    so we tried to come up with a new API.
  </p>
  <p>
    We chose to call the system <em>server push</em>, which is the common name for technologies that
    simulate a push update from an HTTP server to a client.
    To activate the server push, you can create a new <em>ServerPushSession</em> and start it.
    The push session can be stopped when it is no longer needed
    (in contrast to UICallBack, this can now be done from any thread).
    As long as there are any push sessions running, the framework will keep the server push system
    active.
  </p>

  <h3>BrowserHistory replaced by BrowserNavigation service</h3>
  <p>
    The <em>BrowserHistory</em> and related classes have been replaced by
    the more general <em>BrowserNavigation</em> client service.
    The new name will allow us to add more
    navigation features to this service that are not directly related to history.
    All features of BrowerHistory are retained,
    see the <a href="migration-guide/">migration guide</a> for a code example.
  </p>

  <h3>Application store replaced by Application context</h3>
  <p>
    The new <em>ApplicationContext</em> represents the running instance of a RAP application, it is
    shared by all UI sessions. This interface replaces IApplicationStore, it can be used to store
    shared data, and also to obtain application-scoped services such as the resource manager.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like the UISession is built on the servlet container's HttpSession, the ApplicationContext
    is built on the <em>ServletContext</em>, and its life cycle is also bound to lifetime of the
    servlet context.
    We chose the name Application<em>Context</em> to highlight this analogy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interface <em>IApplicationStore</em> has been renamed to <em>ApplicationContext</em>.
    An instance can be acquired from <code>RWT.getApplicationContext()</code> which replaces
    the old method <code>RWT.getApplicationStore()</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the <em>get/setAttribute</em> methods, <em>ApplicationContext</em> has accessor
    methods for the resource manager and the service manager.
    Actually, <code>RWT.getResourceManager()</code> is now simply a shortcut for
    <code>RWT.getApplicationContext().getResourceManager()</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Service handlers</h3>
  <p>
    The interface <em>ServiceHandler</em> has been changed.
    The <em>service</em> method now provides two parameters <em>request</em> and <em>response</em>
    to the implementation.
    Developers don't have to obtain the request and response objects from static methods anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>ServiceManager</em> has got a new method <em>getServiceHandlerUrl( String )</em>.
    Developers should use this new method to obtain the URL to access a service handler instead
    of assembling the URL manually.
  </p>

  <h3>Resource Manager Rework</h3>
  <p>
    The resource manager (<em>IResourceManager</em>) is used to register static resources like
    images or JavaScript files in RAP applications. We reduced its interface to this purpose
    and simplified the implementation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      For resources that are registered in an <em>ApplicationConfiguration</em>, the method
      <em>Application.addResource(…)</em> now accepts a <em>ResourceLoader</em> instead of
      <em>IResource</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <em>IResource</em> interface is now only used in the extension point
      <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.resources</em> and has therefore been moved to the bundle
      <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.workbench</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The encoding of a resource is not taken into account anymore, <em>getCharset()</em> has
      been removed from the <em>IResource</em> interface.
      If you used to register text files with a charset other than UTF-8, you should make sure that
      your client code reads the resources with the correct charset.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Method <em>getOptions()</em> has been removed from the <em>IResouce</em> interface.
      This means:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The resource manager can not minify JavaScript anymore.
          It is recommend that custom component developers minify their JavaScript files with a tool
          such as <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">YUI Compressor</a>,
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/">Google Closure Compiler</a>,
          or <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html">JSMin</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The resource manager can not add version hashes to file names anymore.
          If there is a need to add version hashes to URLs, applications can simply add a URL parameter
          like <em>"?nocache=4711"</em> when requesting the resource.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Moreover, the resource manager does not close input streams anymore after registering a resource,
    as it did in 1.5 (<?=bug(347615)?>). Double check that you're closing your input streams correctly.
  </p>

  <h3>Dropped Support for entrypoints by name</h3>
  <p>
    Until now, entrypoints could be registered with a name in an entrypoint extension.
    Those entrypoints had been available at a URL with the default servlet name “rap” and a URL
    parameter “startup” pointing to this name. This approach had a number of drawbacks, thus we
    decided to remove the support for it completely in RAP 2.0. Now
    entrypoints can only be registered by path, which was introduced in RAP 1.5.
    For example, an entrypoint that is registered with the path <code>/foo</code> will be available
    at:
  </p>
<pre>
http://hostname/webapp/foo
</pre>
  </p>

  <h2>Branding</h2>

  <h3>Entrypoint mapping</h3>
  <p>
    Since entrypoints are now always registered by path, there is no need for an entrypoint-to-path
    mapping in a branding anymore.
    Therefore, we removed the attributes <em>servletName</em>, <em>defaultEntrypointId</em>, and the
    element <em>associatedEntrypoints</em> from the <em>branding</em> extension point.
    A branding can now be bound to an entrypoint by setting the new attribute <em>brandingId</em>.
  </p>
<pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.rap.ui.entrypoint"&gt;
  &lt;entrypoint id="example.entrypoint"
      class="example.MyEntryPoint"
      path="/example"
      <strong>brandingId="example.branding"</strong> /&gt;
  &lt;/entrypoint&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>

  <h3>Exit confirmation</h3>
  <p>
    For exit confirmations, the new client service <em>ExitConfirmation</em> should be used as
    explained above.
    The attribute <em>exitConfirmationClass</em> is no longer supported by the branding extension
    point.
  </p>

  <h3>Branding API removed from RWT</h3>
  <p>
    With these changes, we also removed the branding API from RWT, namely the classes
    <em>AbstractBranding</em> and <em>Header</em>.
    We don't expect that anyone was using these classes.
    In plain RWT applications, entrypoint properties can be used for branding.
  </p>

  <h2>IApplication</h2>
  <p>
    If you use the interface <em>IApplication</em> as entrypoint to your application,
    you now have to add an entrypoint extension to your <em>plugin.xml</em>
    in order to bind the application to a path.
    To do so, create a new entrypoint extension and, instead of providing an EntryPoint class,
    specify the id of the application extension in the new parameter <em>applicationId</em>:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.rap.ui.entrypoint"&gt;
  &lt;entrypoint id="example.application.entrypoint"
      path="/example"
      brandingId="example.branding"
      <strong>applicationId="example.application"</strong> /&gt;
  &lt;/entrypoint&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>

  <h2>Settings</h2>

  <h3>Development Mode</h3>
  <p>
    During development, it's recommended to start RAP in </en>development mode</en>.
    In this mode, the JavaScript for the web client is not compressed and potential client-side
    errors will not be caught.
    This new setting replaces the old <em>clientLibraryVersion</em>, which has been used for this
    purpose before.
    In the RAP Launcher, you'll find a new option to enable the development mode:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="framed" title="Development mode" src="images/RAPLauncher-dev-mode.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    In OSGi launch configurations, please replace the VM parameter
    <code>-Dorg.eclipse.rwt.clientLibraryVersion=DEBUG</code> with
    <code>-Dorg.eclipse.rap.rwt.developmentMode=true</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>Tools</h2>

  <h3>RAP Launcher always terminates previous launch</h3>
  <p>
    The RAP launcher has an option to terminate an already running application before starting a
    new one. This turned out to be a valuable feature, particularly when working with fixed ports.
    We couldn't find a good reason to ever disable this functionality, so we decided to remove the
    option from the launcher while keeping the default behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="framed" title="Text with search icons" src="images/Tools-remove-previous-launch.png" />
