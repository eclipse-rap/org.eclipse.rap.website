  <h2>Network / Communication</h2>

  <p>
    In 1.5 we replaced the communication between server and client with a new, JSON-based format.
    Now, the client uses the same format to report changes to the server.
    With this change, the entire communication uses the JSON protocol.
    No HTTP request parameters are involved anymore.
    All widgets LCAs have been reworked to handle the new JSON-based message.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    The exact format is described in the
    <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Protocol">RAP Protocol wiki page</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>API Changes</h2>

  <p>
    With the move to RAP 2.0, we are cleaning up our APIs.
    This will lead to breaking changes.
    Existing RAP 1.x applications will therefore need minor adjustments to work with RAP 2.0.
    See the <a href="migration-guide/">RAP 2.0 Migration Guide</a> for instructions on updating
    your code to RAP 2.0.
  </p>

  <h3>Package org.eclipse.rwt renamed</h3>

  <p>
    We renamed this package to org.eclipse.rap.rwt in order to comply with Eclipse naming
    convention that packages should be prefixed with the project that creates it.
  </p>

  <h3>Constant WidgetUtil.CUSTOM_VARIANT moved</h3>

  <p>
    This constant has been moved to the class RWT.
  </p>

  <h3>Deprecated public classes and methods removed</h3>

  <h2>New Client API</h2>

  <p>
    Now that alternative clients can be connected to a RAP server, applications will need to
    distinguish between different clients, e.g. to render parts differently on certain clients.
    Clients with additional capabilities like gps, camera, etc. should also be able to expose
    those client-specific features to applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    To support those cases, we added a service provider interface <em>Client</em> that can be
    acquired using the new method <em>RWT.getClient()</em>.
    Client implementations can provide services, such as a geo-location service, a script execution
    service, etc. Here's an example:
  </p>

<pre lang="java">
Client client = RWT.getClient();
LocationService service = client.getService( LocationService.class );
if( service != null ) {
  service.getAddress();
  ...
}
</pre>

  <p>
    Unless you have a custom client implementation installed, <em>RWT.getClient()</em> will always
    return an instance of <em>WebClient</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>Widget Set</h2>

  <h3>Touch-Scrolling for Tree and Table</h3>

  <p>
    Tree and Table widgets can now be scrolled on mobile devices (iOS and Android) by dragging a row
    with one finger. However, Tree and Table can only scroll item-by-item, not smooth as like the
    List.
  </p>

  <h3>SWT.ICON_SEARCH and SWT.ICON_CANCEL support for Text widget</h3>

  <p>
    Text widget now have full support for SWT.ICON_SEARCH and SWT.ICON_CANCEL style flags.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3>Themeing enhancements</h3>

  <p>
    The themeablity of some widgets has been improved. The following properties and states have been 
    added:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>box-shadow</code> property for DateTime
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>hover</code> state and <code>text-decoration</code> property for List-Hyperlink
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>text-decoration</code> property for Button
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>disabled</code> state for Combo-Button-Icon
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tools</h2>

  <h3>RAP Launcher always terminates previous launch</h3>
  <p>
    The RAP launcher has an option to terminate an already running application before starting a
    new one. This turned out to be a valuable feature, particularly when working with fixed ports.
    We couldn't find a good reason to ever disable this functionality, so we decided to remove the
    option from the launcher while keeping the default behavior.
