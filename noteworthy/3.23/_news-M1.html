    <h2>Add missing <code>QuickAccess</code> support from latest RCP Platform</h2>

    <p>
        The <code>QuickAccess</code> code base from Eclipse Platform has been ported and adopted to RAP,
        and can be tested in the RAP demo application. A thank you to the developers from GODYO who made
        this possible!
