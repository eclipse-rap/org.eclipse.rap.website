<h2>Getting started instructions</h2>
<p>The easiest was to get involved with RAP is to install it from a software 
  repository. This requires the following steps:
</p>

<p><strong>For Eclipse 3.6 or later...</strong>
<ul style="margin-left:10px">
  <li>With Eclipse up and running, select the <strong>Help</strong> &gt; 
      <strong>Install New Software ...</strong> menu entry.</li>
  <li>Enter enter the RAP Update Site URL 
    <strong>http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/1.3/tooling</strong>.
    into the <strong>Work with</strong> field and press Enter.
  <li>After a short while, an entry labelled <em>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</em> appears 
    in the list below. Select its check box and click <strong>Next</strong>.
    </li>
  <li>On the the next page you may review the installation details.</li>
  <li>Accept the terms in the license agreement and click the 
      <strong>Finish</strong> button.</li>
  <li>The feature and plug-ins will now be downloaded from the repository and
      installed locally. Note that you may be prompted to confirm if it is ok
      to install unsigned jar files.</li>
  <li>Confirm the following prompt to restart Eclipse.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>After Eclipse restarts, a welcome page is displayed. Select the <strong>Rich 
Ajax Platform (RAP)</strong> section and choose <strong>Install Target 
Platform</strong> on the following page. In the upcoming dialog confirm the 
default values, which starts the target installation process.
</p>

<p>After the installation finished you are prepared to work with RAP.
For your first steps you may read the
<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.rap.help/help/html/getting-started/examples.html">RAP Examples</a>
topic and/or the other chapters of the getting started section.
