  <h1>Getting Started</h1>

  <p>
    To get started, you should have an Eclipse IDE with RAP tooling installed.
    It's easiest to get the Eclipse package for RCP and RAP developers.
    See the <a href="/rap/downloads/">downloads page</a> for details.

    This screencast shows how to get started with developing RAP applications.
    It covers RAP target installation, creating a new RAP application and
    launching it in a web browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Let the RAP Tooling install the target platform</h2>
  <p>
    When Eclipse starts on a fresh workspace, a welcome page is displayed.
    Select the <strong>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</strong> section and
    choose <strong>Install Target Platform</strong> on the following page.
    In the upcoming dialog confirm the default values, which starts the target
    installation process.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the installation finished you are prepared to work with RAP.
    For your first steps you may read the
