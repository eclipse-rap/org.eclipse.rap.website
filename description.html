  The Remote Application Platform (RAP) is a framework for modular business applications
  that can be accessed from different types of clients including web browsers, rich clients,
  and mobile devices. It provides a powerful, multi-platform widget toolkit with SWT API
  that enables developers to write applications entirely in Java and re-use the same code
  on different platforms.

  Regardless of the client platform, RAP applications run on a server that communicates with its
  clients over HTTP.  Applications can therefore be deployed on any servlet container. With the
  RAP OSGi integration, they can be composed of modules and communicate using the OSGi service
  model.
