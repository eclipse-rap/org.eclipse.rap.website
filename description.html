  The RAP project enables developers to build rich, Ajax-enabled Web
  applications by using the Eclipse development model, plug-ins with the well 
  known Eclipse workbench extenstion points, JFace, and a widget toolkit with 
  SWT API (using  <a href="http://qooxdoo.org">qooxdoo</a> for the client-side 
  presentation).
  <br />
  The project has released version 1.3 together with the 
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/helios/">Eclipse Helios</a> release.
  and is working on version 1.4 that will be released together with
  Eclipse Indigo in June 2011.
