  The Rich Ajax Platform (RAP) is a framework for modular business applications for the desktop,
  web browser, and mobile devices. It provides a powerful, multi-platform widget toolkit with
  SWT API that enables developers to write applications entirely in Java and re-use the same code
  on different platforms.

  Regardless of the client platform, RAP applications run on a server that communicates with its
  clients over HTTP.  Applications can therefore be deployed on any servlet container. With the
  RAP OSGi integration, they can be composed of modules and communicate using the OSGi service
  model.
