  The RAP project enables developers to build rich, Ajax-enabled Web
  applications by using the Eclipse development model, plug-ins with the well 
  known Eclipse workbench extenstion points, JFace, and a widget toolkit with 
  SWT API (using  <a href="http://qooxdoo.org">qooxdoo</a> for the client-side 
  presentation).
  The project has released version 1.1 together with the Eclipse ganymede release.
