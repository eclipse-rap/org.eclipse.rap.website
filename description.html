  The Rich Ajax Platform (RAP) enables developers to build rich, Ajax-enabled
  Web applications by using the same tools and APIs as for RCP development.
  Frontends can be built with SWT, JFace, and the Eclipse Workbench including
  the well known extension points.
  Applications are composed of OSGi bundles that run on server-side
  Equinox.
  <br />
  The project has released version 1.4 that is part of
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/indigo">Eclipse Indigo</a>
  and is working on version 1.5 that will be released together with
  Eclipse Juno in June 2012.
